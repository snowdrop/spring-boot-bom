= Spring Boot BOM - 2.5.x

This Bill Of Materials for Spring Boot 2.5.8 contains starters which are currently used by the
https://github.com/snowdrop?utf8=âœ“&q=topic%3Abooster[Spring Boot Mission Boosters].
This document is updated on a "best effort" basis, based on the information contained in the `pom.xml` file. In case of inconsistency between this document and the POM file, the POM information prevails.

This BOM is aligned to:

.Spring
// spring-boot
- Spring Boot: 2.5.12

.Spring Cloud
// spring-cloud-kubernetes
- https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-kubernetes[Spring Cloud Kubernetes]: 2.0.4

.Integration
- RESTEasy: 3.15.3.Final
// tomcat
- Tomcat: 9.0.60

.ORM
// hibernate
- Hibernate: 5.4.33
// hibernate-validator
- Hibernate Validator: 6.2.3.Final

== Versioning scheme

This BOM is using the following versioning scheme:

`dev.snowdrop:snowdrop-dependencies:<targeted spring boot release version>.<qualifier>[1-9]`

.Qualifiers, in chronological order:
 - `Alpha` (first semi-stable releases),
 - `Beta` (no more API changes, bugs might still occur),
 - `CR` (Candidate Release, release quality but minor bugs or known postponed issues are possible),
 - `Final` (release version),
 - `SP` (Service Patch, post-release version for fixes needed after a release).

Qualifiers are numbered and we should try to limit their number to 9 but we should still be able to handle more than 10 versions for a given qualifier.

Until a version is released, the BOM version will be `<target spring boot version>-SNAPSHOT`. Once it's released, we will switch to `<target spring boot version>.SP<current SP version + 1>-SNAPSHOT`.

So, right now, as we are targeting Spring Boot version 2.3.2.RELEASE, our BOM GAV will be:
`dev.snowdrop:snowdrop-dependencies:2.3.2-SNAPSHOT` until released. The released version will be
`dev.snowdrop:snowdrop-dependencies:2.3.2.Final` and the new version in the 2.3 branch will
be `dev.snowdrop:snowdrop-dependencies:2.3.2.SP1-SNAPSHOT`.

See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/SB-162[SB-162] for a discussion of BOM versioning.

== Releasing

The artifacts are released on http://central.sonatype.org/[Sonatype Open Source Software Repository Hosting (OSSRH)], which is
then synchronized to Maven Central. To perform a release, you need to activate the `release` profile.

0. Make sure that your computer is properly set up as explained in http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html. In
particular, this implies having a Sonatype JIRA account, added the appropriate configuration in your Maven `settings.xml` and
having GPG set up on your computer.
0. Check this README for outdated information, notably dependency versions.
1. Prepare the release: `mvn release:prepare -Prelease` on a "clean" repository (i.e. everything is committed and pushed). Note
that the project version in the POM file needs to end in `-SNAPSHOT` to be recognized as needing release.
    - The release plugin will ask you several questions based on the current project version. Let's assume we're trying to
    release the `1.5.8.Beta2` of the BOM. The current project version should be `1.5.8-SNAPSHOT` if the version conventions
    (above) have been properly followed. Based on this, the release plugin will offer to release version `1.5.8` of the BOM.
    - Override this version by type `1.5.8.Beta2`
    - Override the tag name to use the same version: `1.5.8.Beta2` instead of the default suggestion
    - Override the suggested next release version as appropriate, in this case, since we're haven't released a final version of
    the 1.5.8 BOM, the next version still needs to be `1.5.8-SNAPSHOT`.
2. Once this prepare step is done, check that everything is as expected and then release: `mvn release:perform -Prelease`.
3. If everything went well, the new artifact should be available on Maven Central after a couple of minutes.

Note that the Sonatype release plugin is configured to auto-release the artifacts from staging, resulting in a faster, more
automated release process. This is not mandatory and can be changed in the plugin configuration.
